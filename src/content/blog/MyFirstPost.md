# Welcome to My First Post

This is my first blog post - if you can call it that.

Honestly, its doubtful I'll post anything here, but I really like Astro's Markdown support and 
wanted to give it a try!

## What Would I Write About?

Anything interesting from my coding projects, random thoughts - but probably nothing important.

## Creating This Website

Wanted to use a static site generator to replace my old Github Page - that has not been updated in 5 years.

Looking around, Astro seemed to be a solid choice - and as mentioned, the Markdown support was appealing.

Starting with an [Astro template](https://astro.build/themes/1/) was tempting, but was envisioning:
- A single page with a sidebar that updated as scrolling progressed
- A collapsible "Blog" section (in case I become a prolific poster, which is 
  certainly an example of "over-engineering" - if you consider adding a collapsible parent as "engineering")
- The entire content of each blog post should be shown

No templates matched these preferences - at least, none that I saw before deciding "I could use Cursor instead".  
This went pretty smooth thanks to planning bulleted tasks up-front, and knowing when to ask for splitting up 
files along with other best practices.

The obvious trade-off, is that this website looks pretty bad.
But the layout is what I wanted, so maybe I'll put some time into theming later - and maybe even a post about it.
